That Republican sense of humour really kills!*   (*Not as much as subzero temperatures in a Texan home without power, but still)   Fuck the GOP\n",
      "(2021-02-26), @kfuentesgeorge: @Matthew_Hodson @bibixbeau People who are older but hotter than me make me angry. SCREW YOU, BUDDY.  (Also, glad to see you're doing well. Keep thriving!)\n",

      "(2021-02-26), @kfuentesgeorge: @andrewsebald @policygarda You are not wrong. It's also why realists historically described a period of rampant colonialism, globalized racism, genocide, and ethnic cleansing in the name of white supremacy (i.e. pre-WWI and post-WWII) as \"peaceful.\"\n",

      "(2021-02-26), @kfuentesgeorge: @eilatg @emtomology From what I understand, for the 2 dose vaccine, there's a window for the second dose to remain effective. In other words, vaccinating someone and waiting too long to give the second renders it less effective. Hence the hurry to complete the cycle rather than expand.\n",

      "(2021-02-25), @kfuentesgeorge: Hey @jennortegren, in your NEH application, at what point did your LOR writers get notified that they were supposed to submit a letter? Is there a particular step that I take to make that happen? I notified them already, and uploaded their info but they haven't heard from the NEH\n",

      "(2021-02-25), @kfuentesgeorge: @profmusgrave Who could blame the students? So many of the \"canonical\" IR texts have authors explicitly saying: \"what I'm about to tell you is the 100%, absolutely objective truth, unbound by time and prejudice.\"\n",
      "(2021-02-25), @kfuentesgeorge: Am genuinely baffled that \"Lolita\" was ever described as ‚Äúthe only convincing love story of our century‚Äù by anybody. It's a great book, but like??? It's very obviously a horror story??? Written from the perspective of the monster???\n",

I'd been using my garage gym till fall, living room \"gym\" in early winter, and XC skiing recently to keep from deteriorating too much.
