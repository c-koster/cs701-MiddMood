# So far we've found that the dodds word score (linear evaluation metric) is not
# effectivee at scoring tweets. But it *might* be good on news articles, so I've
# worked out a text scraper to do this work for me.

# So what do we need to do next?

# 1. try out the dodds model on my news files

# 2. try out the BERT model on tweets, and devise some way of producing a summary
# statistic for a week's worth of tweets. Maybe based upon the ratio of positive
# and negative ones?

# 2b.

# 3. generate a jsonl object which will be easy for hirona to plot later.

# 4. do some research on 'trending topics', 'named entity recognition', etc...
# we want meaningful word cloud display

# 5. (on paper) make a story board for what the site layout should look like
